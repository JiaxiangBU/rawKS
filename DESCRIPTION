Description: The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistic is a standard method to measure the model strength for 
    credit risk scoring models. This package calculates the Kâ€“S statistic and 
    plots the true-positive rate and false-positive rate to measure the model strength. 
    This package was written with the credit marketer, who uses risk models in 
    conjunction with his campaigns. The users could read more details from 
    Thrasher (1992) <doi:10.1002/dir.4000060408> and 'pyks' <https://pypi.org/project/pyks/>.
